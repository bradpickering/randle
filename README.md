# Randle
Random letter guessing game inspired by the popular game [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html)

Available on my [GitHub Pages](https://bradpickering.github.io/randle/)

## How to play
 Guess the RANDLE in six tries. There are <strong>NO</strong> duplicate letters (duplicates make it nearly impossible).
 
 Each guess must be a valid five-letter string of letters. Hit the enter button to submit.
 
 After each guess, the color of the tiles will change to show how close your guess was to the random string of letters.
 - Green indicates the guessed letter is in the correct spot.
 - Yellow indicates the guessed letter is in the string but in the incorrect spot.
 - Gray indicates the guessed letter is not in the string.
